- **Standalone Components**: All major features testable independently
- **Authentication Testing**: Admin and regular user flows verified

#### 3. Advanced Bug Fixes & UX Improvements

- **Fixed Import Errors**: ContextualHelp import in ToolGuidanceWrapper resolved
- **Enhanced Authentication**: Improved workflow progress and session management
- **Interactive Components**: Added test action buttons and user feedback systems

#### 4. Professional UI/UX Enhancements  
- **Dark Theme Optimization**: Professional interface with subtle animations
- **Mobile Responsive**: Touch-optimized components and responsive design
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful failure handling throughout application
- **Advanced Progress Tracking**: Green improvement indicators, baseline comparisons

#### 5. Complete Documentation System
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md**: 400+ line comprehensive project documentation
- **Airtable Schema**: Complete database documentation with setup guides
- **Git History**: Full deployment history and branch management documentation
- **Setup Guides**: Environment validation and testing instructions

### 1. Airtable Field Audit & Data Population
- **Fixed Missing Fields:** Added 4 critical fields to Customer Assets table
  - Competency Progress, Tool Access Status, Professional Milestones, Daily Objectives
  - Note: 3 fields (User Preferences, Detailed ICP Analysis, Target Buyer Personas) may already exist but return DUPLICATE errors
- **CUST_02 Sample Data:** Fully populated with comprehensive test data for all fields
- **Field Names:** Use lowercase names (e.g., "detailed ICP analysis" not "Detailed ICP Analysis")

### 2. Navigation Authentication Fix
- **Issue:** Navigation was routing to `/icp` instead of `/customer/:customerId/dashboard/icp`
- **Solution:** Updated `useNavigation` hook to use absolute paths with customer context
- **File:** `/src/hooks/useNavigation.js` - now properly maintains authentication context

### 3. Admin User System Implementation
- **Admin Access:** Customer ID: `CUST_4`, Token: `admin-demo-token-2025`
- **Admin URL:** `/customer/CUST_4?token=admin-demo-token-2025`
- **Features:**
  - Full platform access without payment
  - Professional sample content for demos
  - Admin mode indicator (blue "Demo Mode" badge)
  - Complete ICP, Cost Calculator, and Business Case content
- **Purpose:** Testing, QA, and sales demonstrations (MVP scope - single user only)

## Key Technical Decisions

### Authentication Flow
- App expects URLs like: `/customer/:customerId?token=accessToken`
- Layout component validates credentials via authService
- Session stored in sessionStorage with 24-hour expiry
- Admin users detected by CUST_4 ID and special token

### Airtable Integration
- **Base ID:** `app0jJkgTCqn46vp9`
- **Customer Assets Table ID:** `tblV61SJBcLwKv0WP`
- **API Key:** Stored in environment (pat5kFmJsBxfL5Yqr...)
- **Field Structure:** JSON strings stored in multilineText fields
- **Direct API:** Use curl for field operations (npx airtable-mcp-server has issues)

### Navigation Architecture
- Progressive engagement flow: Welcome â†’ ICP â†’ Cost Calculator â†’ Business Case
- DashboardLayout with 80/20 split (main content / sidebar)
- NavigationControls component prevents dead-end screens
- Error boundaries for graceful error recovery

## Developer Notes

### When Adding New Features
1. Always check authentication context in navigation
2. Use lowercase field names for Airtable operations
3. Test with both admin (CUST_4) and regular users
4. Maintain error boundaries for graceful failures
5. Use TodoWrite tool to track implementation tasks

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigation maintains customer context
- [ ] Admin mode indicator shows for CUST_4
- [ ] All tools load with sample data
- [ ] Error boundaries catch component failures
- [ ] Build compiles without errors
